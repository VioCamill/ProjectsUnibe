Fille explaining coverage: 


Player: Methode toString and position not covered, because they are trivial getter methodes, swap is unused.

Game: nextPlayer unused, toString not used, because it is a trivial getter methode.

FirstSquare: setList and toString not used, because they are trivial getter methodes.
